In this demo we will show you how to organize your code in order to create a big project!!

In this section we will show you how to create a header file which is surrounding by angle brackets.

The angle brackets means this header file is a standard header file which is located in a default area which is /usr/local 
directory in linux.If you want to use somewhere to put your header file , you need to tell the complier at the compile-time.

So how do we do that?

Use gcc option: -I
gcc -I (dir where you put the header file) -o main -std=c99 -Wall main.c

You can combine with makefile to leve up this process.

And sometimes we want to archive a bunch of object file to generate a library such as library for math.

The instruction is following:

ar -rcs libmylib.a encrypt.o 

The lib is a prefix and the library name is mylib.

eg:

gcc testcode.c -lmylib -o testcode

Please take care that the -l option shoule follow the source code file.
