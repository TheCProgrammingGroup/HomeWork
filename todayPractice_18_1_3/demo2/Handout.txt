In this section, we will show you the power of makefile and how to use it to build the powerful software.

The introduce to make is as following:

In software development, Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and 
libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. 
Though integrated development environments and language-specific compiler features can also be used to manage 
a build process, Make remains widely used, especially in Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

In order to use make to manage the complie process of your program, you need learn to write the file called Makefile.
It is the rules of how to complie your code from source code into executable file.

vim Makefile (create or open a Makefile)

Adding some rules to it about how you want to compile your code.

The grammer is shown below:

Target : dependence
(Tab) complie rules

ex:
print : print.c
	gcc -o print -std=c99 -Wall print.c
